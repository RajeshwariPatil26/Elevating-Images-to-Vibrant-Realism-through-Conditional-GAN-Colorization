# Elevating-Images-to-Vibrant-Realism-through-Conditional-GAN-Colorization
This project uses Conditional GANs with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator to colorize grayscale images. The model, trained on the COCO dataset in Lab color space, ensures realistic and accurate results using adversarial and L1 losses. Implemented in Python and PyTorch.
